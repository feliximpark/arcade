## Playing ArcadeClone

### Goal of the Game
Your goal is to reach the water. In this case you get **one scorepoint**. You will see your collected score-points on the score-table, left of the playing field. But be aware of the bugs. If they hit you while you try to reach the water, you will loose **one life**.

### How to win
To win the game, you have to collect **10 score-points**. In the moment where you collect your tenth point, **you win!!!**

### How to loose
If a bug hits you, you **loose one life**. You have three lifes at the beginning, so be careful. Good news: _You can collect additional lifes!_ Just collect a heart. It´s changing its position in a random number of seconds, sometimes it´ll vanish from the playing field. The bugs are moving on an random speed.

### Whats about the gems?
You can collect gems while you try to reach the shore. You will collect **one gem-point for the greens** and **three gem-points for the blue**. You don´t need the gem-points to win. But maybe you want to be the best player of all, hm? The gems are changing their position in a random number of seconds. Sometimes they vanish from the playing field.

### What about the rocks?
You cannot pass a field with a rock. No way, you have to go around it. The rock  will change its position every time you hit the water and collect a score-point.

## Have fun!
